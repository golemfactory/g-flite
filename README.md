`g-flite` is a command-line utility which lets you run [flite](http://www.festvox.org/flite/)
text-to-speech app on Golem Network.

__Note that `g-flite` currently requires that you have Golem instance running on the same machine
and only testnet is currently supported due to the fact that
[our WASM platform](https://github.com/golemfactory/sp-wasm) is only available on the testnet.__

## Installation
You can grab a precompiled version of the program for each OS, Linux, Mac, and Win, from
[here](https://github.com/golemfactory/g-flite/releases).

### Building from source
If you wish however, you can also build the program from source. To do this, you'll first need
to clone the repo.

```
git clone --depth 50 https://github.com/golemfactory/g-flite
cd g-flite
```

Afterwards, you need to ensure you have Rust installed in version at least `1.34.0`. A good place
to get your hands on the latest Rust is [rustup website](https://rustup.rs/).

With Rust installed on your OS, you then need to simply run from within `g-flite` dir

```
cargo build
```

for debug version, or

```
cargo build --release
```

for release version. Your program can then be found in

```
g-flite/target/debug/g_flite
```

for debug version, or

```
g-flite/target/release/g_flite
```

for release version.

## Usage
Typical usage should not differ much or at all from how you would use the original `flite` app.
So, in order to generate speech from some input text `some_text_input.txt` and save to a WAV file
`some_speech_output.wav`, you would simply run it as


```
g_flite some_text_input.txt some_speech_output.wav
```

Note that it is required to specify the name of the output file. To provide a more concrete example,
let's take the "Moby Dick; Or, The Whale" by Herman Melville. Download the entire book in
a text format [here](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2701/2701-0.txt), and save it as `moby_dick.txt`.
Then, you can convert the book to speech using `g-flite` by simply running

```
g_flite moby_dick.txt moby_dick.wav
```

All of this assumes that you have your Golem installed using the default settings

| Setting     | Default value                 |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- |
| datadir     | `$APP_DATA_DIR/golem/default` |
| RPC address | 127.0.0.1                     |
| RPC port    | 61000                         |

`$APP_DATA_DIR` is platform specific:
* on Linux will usually refer to `$HOME/.local/share/<project_path>`
* on Mac will usually refer to `$HOME/Library/Application Support/<project_path>`
* on Windows will usually refer to `{FOLDERID_LocalAppData}/<project_path>/data`

If any of the above information is not correct for your Golem configuration, you can
adjust them directly in the command-line as follows

```
g_flite --address 127.0.0.1 --port 61000 --datadir /abs/path/to/golem/datadir some_text_input.txt some_speech_output.wav
```

Finally, by default `g-flite` will split your input text into 6 subtasks and compute them
on Golem Network. You can also adjust this option in the command-line as follows

```
g_flite --subtasks 2 some_text_input.txt some_speech_output.wav
```

All of this information can also be extracted from the command-line with the `-h` or `--help` flags

```
g_flite -h
